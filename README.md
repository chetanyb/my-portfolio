# My personal website

This is the source code for my personal website. It is built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [Skeleton UI](https://www.skeleton.dev) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). The website is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Development

To run the website locally, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed. Then, you can run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chetanyb/my-portfolio.git
cd my-portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server.
